# Bike Sharing Assignment
 This project is based upon Multiple Linear Regression which I have used to demonstrate the impact each of the independent variables have on dependent variable.
 The project is based on the data of a bike sharing company named BoomBikes which have collected data to analyse usage of shared bikes being affected by other features such as weather, temperature, years or months or days of a week.

## General Information

  As previously mentioned, the company BoomBikes delivers a service of shared bikes in the US. The company recently suffered huge loss due to corona pandemic. To compensate the loss they had to bare, they have planned to analyse a set of data to be able to provide better service with better revenue generation.
  
  The purpose to create this model is to check which features are effecting the number of usage of bike sharing i.e which variables are correlated to the count of bikes used. Based on the analyzation it'll be easier for the company to fine tune their service without facing loss.
  
  The dataset day.csv has data such as season, year, month, holiday, working day, temperature, humidity, wind speed etc which are being used as independent variables to read the total count of registered and casual bike's demands.

## Conclusions

* It is observed from the analysis that temperature is highly correlated to the cound of bikes used.
* On rainy or snowy days, on holidays, people tend not to use shared bikes. On the other hand, on a pleasant weather people tend to use bikes more.
* Also, with every passing year, the demand of bike sharing is increaing.
